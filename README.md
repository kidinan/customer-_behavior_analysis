# üìä Customer Behavior Analysis

## üìå Overview
This project explores customer shopping behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI. It demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow ‚Äî from data cleaning and feature engineering to SQL querying and dashboard creation. The goal is to uncover actionable insights and present them through interactive visuals and a formal report.

## üìÅ Dataset
- **File**: `customer_shopping_behavior.csv`  
- **Size**: ~3,900 customer records  
- **Description**: Includes customer demographics, purchase patterns, product preferences, and transaction details  
- **Note**: Column headers were cleaned and standardized during preprocessing

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy) | Data loading, cleaning, feature engineering |
| PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server | SQL querying and data storage |
| Power BI | Dashboard creation and visualization |
| Jupyter Notebook | Development and documentation |
| PDF Report | Summary of insights and recommendations |

## üîç Workflow Summary
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Loaded and inspected the dataset
   - Cleaned duplicated headers and missing values
   - Standardized column names
   - Created new features: `age_group`, `purchase_frequency_days`

2. **SQL Integration**
   - Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server
   - Executed queries for customer segmentation, purchase trends, and product performance

3. **Dashboard Creation**
   - Connected Power BI to SQL database
   - Built visuals: KPIs, charts, filters
   - Saved as `customer_behavior_dashboard.pbix`

4. **Reporting**
   - Summarized findings in `Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis.pdf`
   - Included business insights and recommendations

## üìà Dashboard Highlights
- Customer segmentation by age and location  
- Purchase frequency and value distribution  
- Product category performance  
- Seasonal shopping trends  
- Interactive filters for dynamic exploration

> üìé Open `customer_behavior_dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop to explore.

## ‚úÖ Key Outcomes
- Cleaned and structured raw customer data  
- Engineered meaningful features for analysis  
- Demonstrated SQL integration across multiple platforms  
- Delivered a professional dashboard and report

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kidnan/customer_behavior_analysis.git
   cd customer_behavior_analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary pymysql pyodbc
   ```

3. **Run the notebook**
   Open `Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter and run all cells.

4. **Set up SQL database**
   - Choose PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server
   - Update credentials in the notebook
   - Run the SQL cells to load data

5. **Open Power BI Dashboard**
   - Launch `customer_behavior_dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop
   - Update data source credentials if needed

6. **Review the Report**
   - Open `Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis.pdf` for a summary of findings
